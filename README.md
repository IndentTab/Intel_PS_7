# Visual Search using VLM
Using CLIP to generate image and text embeddings and FAISS to search through a dataset of 50k images to provide visual search.

## Running
Run `Gradio.ipynb`, change the constants pointing to where the images are stored. Note, `IMAGE_FOLDER_PATH` also needs to be updated after the images have been extracted.
